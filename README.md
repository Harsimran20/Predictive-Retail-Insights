# 🧠 Retail Data ML Pipeline: EDA, Outliers & Feature Categorization

This project presents a modular and scalable machine learning pipeline designed to perform end-to-end data processing, including summary statistics, outlier detection using IQR, and feature type analysis for structured datasets such as customer or retail data.

## 📊 Features

- Automated summary statistics generation
- IQR-based outlier detection
- Feature categorization (numerical, categorical)
- Clean modular code structure (via `src/`)
- Sample dataset included (`retail_customers.csv`)
